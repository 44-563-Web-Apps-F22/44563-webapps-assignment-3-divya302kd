    <p>Dinosaur fossils have been found on all seven continents.
         All non-avian dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago. There are roughly 700 known species of extinct dinosaurs. 
        Modern birds are a kind of dinosaur because they share a common ancestor with non-avian dinosaurs.</p>

                In 1842, the English naturalist Sir Richard Owen coined the term Dinosauria, 
                derived from the Greek deinos, meaning “fearfully great,” and sauros, meaning “lizard.”
