            Shot composition was too good which is one aspect I always appreciate in SSR movies. 
            The use of the foreground in the earlier frames of this spectacle subtly taught us about the environment 
            we are being transported to. Cinematography by 
            Senthil truly blew my mind, the use of rack focuses was very unique in a minimal way.
             To emphasize SSRs vision</p>
